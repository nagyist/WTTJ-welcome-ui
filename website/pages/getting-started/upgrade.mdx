yarn migrate "../yourProject/src/**/**.**(tsx|ts|js)"
```

## Theme

### Colors

We changed our colors dark and light to be full compatible with dark mode. Now dark are black rgba with transparency, and light are white rgba with transparency.

We need also for typescript compatibility rework our colors naming :

- Before : `colors.dark.900`

  - light.700 become dark-200
  - light.500 become dark-400

  - dark.100 become dark-500
  - dark.200 become dark-700
  - dark.500 become dark.900
  - dark.700 become dark.900
